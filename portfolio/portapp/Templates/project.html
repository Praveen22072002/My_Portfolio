        <h2 class="text-center">App development using Flutter flow</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            I have developed a trading app using Flutter Flow, incorporating Supa base as the database and
                Python for backend connectivity. within this setup,
            I have created a Python script to seamlessly populate data in Supa base by interfacing
            with the Stock developer API. The data, once populated, is then displayed within the app.

<!--Second project-->
    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">Web development using Django</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
             I have independently created a website using Django, Python, and Bootstrap that encompasses
            both backend and frontend development.
             This website is a dedicated project within our company and is primarily designed for trading
            purposes.
             Users can easily access, delete, manage, and review their accounts, making it a versatile tool for
            maintaining multiple accounts seamlessly.

<!--Third project-->
    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">Web-automation using python and selenium</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            I have developed a project that automates the login process for two websites.
            This project stores login credentials in private INI files and allows the websites to automatically
            open and log in without manual intervention.
            This automation significantly reduces daily login times and streamlines work processes by
            leveraging Selenium.

<!--    Fourth project-->

    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">Automated telegram messages using python</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            I have successfully completed a solo project where I implemented automated Telegram
            messaging using Python.
            This project involves fetching trading information from a website through an API, parsing the
            relevant data, and then sending automated messages to a specific Telegram group.
            To achieve this, I created a custom Telegram bot that facilitates the seamless distribution of the
            parsed information.

<!--    Fifth project-->
    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">Multi-class brain disease detection using deep learning</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            In our project, we conducted testing on various deep learning imaging algorithms, including VGG16, AlexNet, CNN, SegNet, and ResNet.
            We utilized MRI images obtained from the Kaggle site to evaluate the algorithms' effectiveness
            in detecting various brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, cerebrovascular issues, neoplastic
            conditions, degenerative diseases, and inflammatory disorders.
            By assessing the accuracy scores of each algorithm, we were able to draw conclusions about
            which algorithms provided the most accurate results in image classification for the specific set of
            brain diseases under consideration.

<!--    Sixth project-->

    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">Machine Learning approach for predictive maintenance of aircraft engine</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            Created a web page for predicting failure of aircraft engine before take-off, with the help of
            machine learning we can able to make this prediction model with the trained data set of previous
            engine records.

<!--    Seventh project-->

    <div class="p-5 container border-top">
        <h2 class="text-center">App development using Flutter flow</h2>
        <div class="p-3 content" style="font-family: 'Roboto';font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
            Developed a prediction algorithm for calculating the demand period in advance, so that we can
            be ready or stock up the product in prior time period with this help of algorithm.
